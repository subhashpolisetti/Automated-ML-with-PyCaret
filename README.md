# Automated ML with PyCaret

## PyCaret Overview:

**PyCaret** is an open-source machine learning library in Python designed to simplify the machine learning workflow. It automates complex processes, allowing you to replace hundreds of lines of code with just a few. PyCaret integrates several machine learning libraries like `scikit-learn`, `XGBoost`, and `LightGBM` to streamline tasks.

### PyCaret Workflow:

1. **Setup**: 
    - Prepares the data for modeling by handling preprocessing tasks such as missing value imputation, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.
  
2. **Compare Models**: 
    - PyCaret automatically trains and evaluates multiple models to identify the best-performing one based on a selected metric.
  
3. **Analyze Model**: 
    - Visualize the model's performance through various interactive visualizations, helping to finalize the model for production.
  
4. **Prediction**: 
    - The selected model is used to predict target values on both test and unseen datasets.
  
5. **Save**: 
    - Save the trained model for future use or deployment.
